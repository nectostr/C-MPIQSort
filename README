This is parallel realization of QSort algorithm, written for university task.
Uses MPI lib.

To simply check it download mpi lib, and in project settings change 
linker -> input -> additional depend. -> add msmpi.lib
c/c++ -> general -> additional include dir -> add path to mpi include directory
c/c++ -> preprocessor -> definition -> _SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS;
(It is becourse i use unsafe type of copy)
